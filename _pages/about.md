# 🔍 About Me    
- 👋 Hello there, I am Haocan!
- I am a third-year master's student at the Cognitive Neuroscience Communication Lab at Beijing Normal University, supervised by Professor Guoming Yu. My primary research focuses on persuasion, media effect and cognitive neuroscience communication. Since 2019, I have also collaborated with Professor Kun Tang at Tsinghua University school of public health on projects related to adolescent health and well-being, as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). In the lab, I am mainly responsible for data analysis and have independently led multiple projects. In 2022, I earned my degree in Arts from the Communication University of China in TV Editing and Directing.

- My academic background lies at the intersection of communication, public health, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. I believe that as media—especially AI—becomes deeply interwoven with our lives, there is a pressing need for scholars with interdisciplinary expertise to seize opportunities for groundbreaking innovation. Therefore, I am dedicated to using cross-disciplinary approaches to address real-world health issues, regardless of traditional academic boundaries. I have published 5 papers, with 2 currently under review.  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tr33OgQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-9cf?style=flat&logo=Google%20Scholar">

**Conclusion**
-I used a parallel process latent growth model to track the nonlinear growth trajectories of sexuality knowledge and attitudes, and a mixed effects model to assess whether sexuality education impacts behavioral indicators. Results suggest that more sustained CSE is necessary for vocational high school students in China. Online CSE presents a feasible solution to enhance sexuality knowledge and attitude and bridge the gap in developmental and sexuality education levels. However, behaviors and well-being outcomes did not yield consistent positive results.

From 2018 to 2021, 48,437 posts were analyzed, revealing 21 topics coded and categorized into six main themes: Response Methods, Specific Topics, Promotion, Virus Status, Specific Groups, and Positive Feedback. Additionally, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was employed to further examine the social structures, cultural contexts, and power dynamics underlying the discourse.

- 🌟 My Thesis [Using Neural Signals to Predict Health News Sharing Volume, Individual Media Use, Health Behavior, and Well-being Trajectory](https://osf.io/3hkvx), **Haocan Sun**, Guoming Yu
    - Building on the exploration of neural mechanisms and online information sharing by researchers such as Baek, Chan, Cosme, Doré, Falk, and Scholz, a neuroscience-based approach is gradually unraveling the complexities of the communication puzzle. Taking into account individual differences, cross-cultural media contexts, and language variations, the study aims to replicate this research within the Chinese context. In addition to exploring the relationship between individual neural signals and group-level forwarding records, we aim to explore, using intensive longitudinal methods, whether individual differences in brain activity predict or moderate the dynamic relationships in health behavior, media use, and well-being. In summary, this is an attempt to combine MRI with DSEM.


- [Revisiting Trust in the Era of Generative AI: Factorial Structure and Latent Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10199), **Haocan Sun**, Weizi Liu, Di Wu, Guoming Yu, Mike Yao
    - Trust is one of the most important factors shaping whether and how people adopt and rely on artificial intelligence (AI). Yet most existing studies measure trust in terms of functionality, focusing on whether a system is reliable, accurate, or easy to use, while giving less attention to the social and emotional dimensions that are increasingly relevant for today's generative AI (GenAI) systems. These systems do not just process information; they converse, respond, and collaborate with users, blurring the line between tool and partner. In this study, we introduce and validate the Human-AI Trust Scale (HAITS), a new measure designed to capture both the rational and relational aspects of trust in GenAI. Drawing on prior trust theories, qualitative interviews, and two waves of large-scale surveys in China and the United States, we used exploratory (n = 1,546) and confirmatory (n = 1,426) factor analyses to identify four key dimensions of trust: Affective Trust, Competence Trust, Benevolence & Integrity, and Perceived Risk. We then applied latent profile analysis to classify users into six distinct trust profiles, revealing meaningful differences in how affective-competence trust and trust-distrust frameworks coexist across individuals and cultures. Our findings offer a validated, culturally sensitive tool for measuring trust in GenAI and provide new insight into how trust evolves in human-AI interaction. By integrating instrumental and relational perspectives of trust, this work lays the foundation for more nuanced research and design of trustworthy AI systems.

- [Emotionally Vulnerable Subtype of Internet Gaming Disorder: Measuring and Exploring the Pathology of Problematic Generative AI Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06908), **Haocan Sun**, Di Wu, Weizi Liu, Guoming Yu, Mike Yao
    - Concerns over the potential over-pathologization of generative AI (GenAI) use and the lack of conceptual clarity surrounding GenAI addiction call for empirical tools and theoretical refinement. This study developed and validated the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9 items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426). Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered (network analysis) approaches revealed a 5-10% prevalence rate, a symptom network structure similar to IGD, and predictive factors related to psychological distress and functional impairment. These findings indicate that PUGenAI shares features of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD rather than the competence-based type. These results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while avoiding over-pathologizing.

- *2022.09 - 2025.06*, Beijing Normal University (BNU), Beijing, China
    - Major, Communication, Faculty of Journalism and Communication
    - Minor, Psychology, Faculty of Psychology
    - During my master's studies, the theories and methods of communication were insufficient to meet my aspirations in health communication. Therefore, neuroscience and psychology expanded my toolkit, while the public health perspective drove me to address real-world problems and draw impactful conclusions.

- *2018.09 - 2022.06*, Communication University of China (CUC), Beijing, China
    - Major, TV Editing and Directing, Faculty of Journalism and Communication
    - During my undergraduate years, I studied journalism and received four years of training in text and image editing. I learned how to use journalism to promote social progress. However, rather than standing in opposition to the government to supervise, I am more inclined to conduct practical research and health interventions that can directly contribute to policy-making. Therefore, I am committed to becoming a health communication scholar.
