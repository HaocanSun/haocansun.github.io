# üîç About Me¬†¬†¬†¬†
- üëã Hello there, I am Haocan!
- I am a third-year master's student at the Cognitive Neuroscience Communication Lab at Beijing Normal University, supervised by Professor Guoming Yu. My primary research focuses on human-computer interaction and cognitive neuroscience communication. Since 2019, I have also collaborated with Professor Kun Tang at Tsinghua University on projects related to adolescent health and well-being, as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). In the lab, I am mainly responsible for data analysis and have independently led multiple projects. In 2022, I earned my degree in Arts from the Communication University of China in TV Editing and Directing.

- My academic background lies at the intersection of communication studies, public health, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. I believe that as media‚Äîespecially AI‚Äîbecomes deeply interwoven with our lives, there is a pressing need for scholars with interdisciplinary expertise to seize opportunities for groundbreaking innovation. Therefore, I am dedicated to using cross-disciplinary approaches to address real-world health issues, regardless of traditional academic boundaries. I have published 3 papers, with 4 others currently under review.  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tr33OgQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-9cf?style=flat&logo=Google%20Scholar">

**Conclusion**
-This study used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and sentiment analysis to investigate the distribution of themes and people‚Äôs reactions during AIDS Weeks. From 2018 to 2021, 48,437 posts were analyzed, revealing 21 topics coded and categorized into six main themes: Response Methods, Specific Topics, Promotion, Virus Status, Specific Groups, and Positive Feedback. Additionally, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was employed to further examine the social structures, cultural contexts, and power dynamics underlying the discourse.

- Women are portrayed through family-oriented lenses, and an Iron Lady image has emerged, perpetuating shallow perceptions of femininity and maintaining male power. Furthermore, female actors composed only one-fifth of all actors, and there were no female cinematographers or editors.

# üìñ Under Review

- **The Journal of Sex Research Under Review R2** [Feasibility and Impact of School-Based Online Comprehensive Sexuality Education in China: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial](https://github.com/HaocanSun/Wellcome-my-papers/blob/main/Feasibility%20and%20impact%20of%20school-based%20online%20comprehensive%20sexuality%20education%20on%20Vocational%20High%20School%20Students%3A%20a%20cluster-randomized%20controlled%20trial%20%20.pdf), **Haocan Sun**, Shuangyu Zhao, Hanxiyue Zhang, Kun Tang
    - This is an article I really like, though the review process seems to be challenging. I used a parallel process latent growth model to track the nonlinear growth trajectories of sexuality knowledge and attitudes, and a mixed effects model to assess whether sexuality education impacts behavioral indicators.


- **Science Communication Under Review** [Effect of Emphasizing the Climate Change Background to Cultivate Supporters and Information Engagers of Genetically Modified Crops](https://github.com/HaocanSun/Wellcome-my-papers/blob/main/Effect%20of%20Emphasizing%20the%20Climate%20Change%20Background%20to%20Cultivate%20Supporters%20and%20Information%20Engagers%20of%20Genetically%20Modified%20Crops.pdf), Dechuan Liu, **Haocan Sun**, Jinghong Xu
    - I am responsible for the methodology section of a paper, which examines how background framing strategies in news reports (specifically, the positive impact of genetically modified crops on climate) influence people's attitudes and behaviors toward GMOs. The study employs an online experiment and uses Latent Moderated Structural Equations (LMS) to analyze the data.

- **BMC Public Health Under Review** [Stakeholder Perceptions of Early Essential Newborn Care Training in Western China: A Qualitative Study](https://github.com/HaocanSun/Wellcome-my-papers/blob/main/Stakeholder%20Perceptions%20of%20Early%20Essential%20Newborn%20Care%20Training%20in%20Western%20China.pdf), (Co-first author) Hanxiyue Zhanga, **Haocan Sun**, ..., Tao Xu, Kun Tang
    - In this study, we collected data through interviews and focus groups, engaging individuals involved in Early Essential Newborn Care Training, from frontline staff and caregivers to provincial leaders and hospital directors. Our findings highlight both the benefits and the challenges faced throughout the training process.

# üí° On-Going Projects¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

- [Development and Validation of the Human-GAI Trust Scale](https://osf.io/mk8d9/), **Haocan Sun**, Weizi Liu, Di Wu, Guoming Yu, Mike Yao
    - Existing scales have not kept pace with the transformations introduced by GAI, lacking a validated reflective scale and tests of cross-cultural invariance. This study introduces the interpersonal paradigm (human-to-human) into human-AI interaction, develops and validates a GAI trust scale, and examines its applicability across different cultural contexts in China and the United States.

- [Development and Validation of the GAI Problematic Use Scale](https://osf.io/mk8d9/), **Haocan Sun**, Di Wu, Weizi Liu, Guoming Yu, Mike Yao
    - Whether in news reports or personal experiences, Gen AI has already become deeply embedded in our lives, leading to functional issues and concerns about its use. Given the emotional support they provide and the potential to promote self-disclosure, people may develop emotional dependence on them. Therefore, drawing an analogy to internet gaming disorder in the DSM-5, we developed a Gen AI addiction scale.

- üåü My Thesis [Neural signals predict information sharing across cultures](https://osf.io/37kba/), **Haocan Sun**, Guoming Yu
    - Dr. Emily Falk and Dr. Scholz's team found that brain regions associated with valuation, self, and social processing accurately predict the shareability of information at a population level, outperforming self-reported sharing intentions. I replicated this study in the context of Chinese-language and health news. In a pilot study (n=6), I found that brain regions associated with self-related processing accurately predicted engagement metrics (shares, comments, and likes), whereas self-reported sharing intentions were unrelated to these metrics.The formal experiment will be conducted in December with a sample size of 40 (n=40).

# üìö Educations¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
- *2022.09 - 2025.06*, Beijing Normal University (BNU), Beijing, China
    - Major, Communication, Faculty of Journalism and Communication
    - Minor, Psychology, Faculty of Psychology
    - During my master's studies, the theories and methods of communication were insufficient to meet my aspirations in health communication. Therefore, neuroscience and psychology expanded my toolkit, while the public health perspective drove me to address real-world problems and draw impactful conclusions.

- *2018.09 - 2022.06*, Communication University of China (CUC), Beijing, China
    - Major, TV Editing and Directing, Faculty of Journalism and Communication
    - During my undergraduate years, I studied journalism and received four years of training in text and image editing. I learned how to use journalism to promote social progress. However, rather than standing in opposition to the government to supervise, I am more inclined to conduct practical research and health interventions that can directly contribute to policy-making. Therefore, I am committed to becoming a health communication scholar.
